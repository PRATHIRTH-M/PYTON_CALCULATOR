# Python Calculator

## Overview
This is a simple calculator program written in Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The program runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

## Features
- **User-friendly interface**: Clearly prompts for input and operation choice.
- **Error handling**: Prevents division by zero and checks for invalid inputs.
- **Continuous usage**: Asks users if they want to perform another calculation or exit.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3 recommended).
2. Download or copy the `calculator.py` file.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the file location.
4. Run the script using:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

## Code Explanation
- **Functions**: The code defines four functions â€” `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()`.
- **Input handling**: Prompts users to select an operation and enter two numbers.
- **Validation**: Includes checks for invalid inputs and handles division by zero.
- **Loop**: The program continues running until the user chooses to exit.

## Example Usage
```
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0
Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no
Thanks for using the calculator!
```

## Future Improvements
- Add support for advanced operations (exponents, square roots, etc.).
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Include history tracking for calculations.
